function Get-TfsCurrentBranchName {
<#
	.SYNOPSIS
	Attempts to get the branch name mapped to the current workspace.
	.DESCRIPTION
	Attempts to get the branch name mapped to the current workspace.  Assumes
	that a branch is mapped and not a sub-folder.  Aside from possibly calling
	the TFS Web services directly, discovering a method to finding  the current
	branch is difficult.
	.NOTES
	Matches 2012.02.28 in a TFS workspace folder like
	$/Web/Source/Release/2012/2012.02.28: D:\tfs\_work

		$index = $current.lastIndexOf("/")
		Write-Output $current.substring($index + 1, $current.length - $index - 1)
	} catch {
		Write-Output $null
